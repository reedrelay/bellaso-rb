# Thoughts

As one of a series of programs to do encryption/decryption of text with a "Vigenere cipher" (See http://en.wikipedia.org/Vigenere_cipher) (Sorry about the lack of accents), this will be a ruby command line version.  I'm calling it (and, presumably, others in the series) Bellaso, since per the article, the cipher was invented by Giovan Battista Bellaso first.

# Basics

Release functionality will have you specify a key as an argument as well as either a plaintext or encrypted file, the opposite state will be delivered via STDOUT.  (Refinements will probably include the possibility of input via STDIN, naturally.)
